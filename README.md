This tool is powerless against IP blocks. Sorry.

This is a fork of ValdikSS' goodbyeDPI, I'm too lazy to make a proper readme, so just see the usage guide shown to you when you use the --help flag.

If you need it encrypted for whatever reason, there is an encrypted archive on the release(s), the password is "goodbyeDPI"
